              <li><strong> Personal Data Collection and Use</strong></li>
              </ol>
              <p>We use Personal Information to facilitate and improve our Services and communicate with you following existing regulations, while data integrity, accuracy, relevancy and legally justified processing are ensured. The data we collect depends on the context of your interactions with us, the choices you make, including your privacy settings, and the products and features listed below:</p>
              <p><strong>3.1 General Information</strong></p>
              <p>The general data we collect can include but not restricted to SDK/API/JS code version, browser, Internet service provider, IP address, platform, timestamp, application identifier, application version, application distribution channel, independent device identifier, Android ad master identifier, network card (MAC) address, and international mobile device identification code (IMEI) the equipment model, the terminal manufacturer, the terminal device operating system version, the session start / stop time, the location of the language, the time zone and the network state (WiFi and so on).</p>
              <p><strong>3.2 Finding Friends and Connecting to Other Services</strong></p>
              <p>Our Services include several features to help connect you to the accounts of people you already know. For example, you may upload information from your address book or connect your NEOTT account to your account on another service such as Twitter. NEOTT will match the information you provide with the contact information of other NEOTT users in order to provide and improve the Services, for example by making recommendations and routing NEOTT messages. You may remove address book data from NEOTT at any time through the settings in your NEOTT app. When you connect your NEOTT account to other services, you are able to post your Content to those services as well. You may disconnect your NEOTT account from your account on the other services at any time. Disconnecting your NEOTT account will immediately revoke our authorization to cross-post on your behalf or otherwise access that account and we will delete information obtained from that connection (other than information that was publicly posted on NEOTT, such as profile information), which may take some time.</p>
              <p><strong>3.3 Content, Following, and other Public Information</strong></p>
              <p>NEOTT is a video streaming platform, so most of the information you provide us is information that you choose to be made public. This includes not only the Content that you post and data provided with such Content, such as when it was posted, but also the accounts you follow, the Content that you like or comment on, and other public interactions on the Services. Your public information is broadly and instantly disseminated. For instance, your profile information and public Content are immediately delivered to a wide range of users and other services that access NEOTT. When you share information or Content via the Services, you should think carefully about what you are making public.</p>
              <p><strong>3.4 Location Information</strong></p>
              <p>In addition to profile information, you may also tell us your exact location if you choose to enable your computer or mobile device to send us location information. We may use and store information about your location to provide features of our Services, such as tagging a video with a location, and to improve and customize the Services, for example, with Content that has been tagged near your location.</p>
              <p><strong>3.5 Links</strong></p>
              <p>We may keep track of how you interact with links across our Services, including our email notifications, third-party services, and client applications, by redirecting clicks or through other means. We do this to help improve our Services, for example to provide relevant advertising, and to be able to share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on.</p>
              <p><strong>3.6 Cookies</strong></p>
              <p>Like many websites, we use "cookie" technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve our Services, but we do not require cookies for many parts of our Services such as viewing public videos.

NEOTT uses Log Data to provide our Services and to measure, customize, and improve them. If not already done earlier, we will either delete Log Data or remove any common account identifiers, such as your username, full IP address, or email address, after 18 months.</p>
